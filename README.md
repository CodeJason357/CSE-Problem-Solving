# CSE-Problem-Solving-Java
# ðŸ§  CSE Problem Solving in Java  

This repository contains my journey of solving problems in Java like a real CSE student.  
Each problem has:  
- Full Java solution  
- Problem description  
- "How to Think" notes (saved as comments in the code)  

---

## ðŸš€ Goal  
- Train my brain to solve problems by thinking step by step.  
- Write my own logic first instead of copying traditional algorithms.  
- Save everything on GitHub for revision and portfolio building.
